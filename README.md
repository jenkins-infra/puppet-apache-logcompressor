# Apache Log Compressor


This is a simple little module that will drop some Ruby code onto a machine and
help set up compression of rotated log files

## Developing

 * `bundle install` to make sure you have all the right gems
 * `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. Use `rake spec_standalone` to
   repeatedly run the tests without reiniitializing test fixtures every time
